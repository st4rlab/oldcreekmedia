The contact form include can be linked with Basin easily.

Use the `email` option in the `/_config.yml` to change to the email submissions will be sent to.

If you'd like to use a different thank you page, set it in ```_includes/contact-form.html```. Just change the ```thanks_url="/some-other-page/"``` tag to some other value.

{% include contact-form.html %}
